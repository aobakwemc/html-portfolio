<h1>The Best Movies I've Enjoyed By AMC</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies as of date.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>Honestly man, past the gruesomeness and violence of the movie, Tony Montana was such a wholesome funny character to watch.</p>
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
<p>This movie just encompasses Italian Mafia and its lifestyle. What I liked most about it was the screen acting and the amount of quotables this came from that movie. Robert De Niro was a delight!</p>
<h3>Casino</h3>
<p>Once again... Rob, Rob, Robert De Niro. What an actor man! Funny guy! Cool, calm & collected. Worth the watch.</p>
